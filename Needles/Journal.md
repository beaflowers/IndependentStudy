<h2>October 16th 2025 - Initialization</h2>

Had to reference my own past work for the easiest way to get the MPR 121 sensor set up again properly, so that was nice. Haha. Also decided to work with Thonny rather than PyCharm, I have no idea why an old prof insisted on PyCharm, but it's so bulky and unnecessary for what I'm doing, Thonny has a built in very very simple terminal system and is so helpful. (Bidirectional framing coming in strong here.) 

Surprised/intrigued that needle still works when going through cloth. I mean I guess it's not that surprising, since cloth isn't a particularly strong resistor, but the fact that it can penetrate something and still work on either side is cool. Currently using cheap sewing needles rather than piercing needles but presumably the effect will be the same, but we're still in deep prototype mode. 

I need to find someone else to either put a needle in me or let me put a needle in them to test the circuit, which feels tricky right now. I might be able to do this myself but that feels a bit precarious and like I'm doing too much - I don't want to be moving around a lot fixing circuitry if I'm also part of the circuit, that seems way too easy for something to fall apart. 

Also what do I want this to LOOK like on a human body? I want it to be a beautiful adornment, halo like wires... Where is the wiring for the LED(s) gonna go, since it's not exactly directly connected to the needle other than through the Pico W. 

So next steps: thoughts on visuals. Also other sensors other than touch - want to do a tilt sensor or something, so it alerts when it's jostled... Again causing discomfort if it's in someone's skin.

ALRIGHT. IM BORED OF SCREENS. WHATS THE SCREEN GONNA DO FOR ME ANYMORE??? 

i want to try this thing that might be a terrible , dangerous and entirely ineffective idea 

ive been tossing it around in my head but want to jot it down:

doing some sort of bdsm needle play that ends up being an electronic interactive adornment. would be amazing to have some capacitive touch wires attached to needles in someone’s skin, and touch making an led light up / move around to different LEDs on other parts of the body. 

the person who becomes(???) the “controller” experiences painful/pleasurable sensation when played with… something something embodiment but make it really really literal 

many issues: human skin is resistant first of all, so all wiring would have to be on the part of needle before it enters skin barrier. this is better for sanitary reasons tho. risk of accidental short circuit and causing unintentional burns… low voltage required to power an LED probably not enough to burn? (not trying to cause harm, just pain!) 

this feels highly inappropriate in an academic context? is it even appropriate in a kink context? seems minimally qualified for safe/sane/consenual? 

goals for the weekend are bust out some needles and see if i can get a circuit working sans human body
crafting bdsm scenes is basically game design (u got a magic circle, particular win conditions, pre determined rules, fantastical scenarios….)
